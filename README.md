1. Hall-Horowitz-Jing (HHJ) method
2. Bühlmann-Künsch method
3. Politis-White method
4. Nonparametric plugin (NPPI) method by Lahiri et al.
5. Methods for tapered block bootstrap variants:
     (a) Original tapered block bootstrap (TBB) by Paparoditis-Politis
     (b) Extended tapered block bootstrap (ETBB) by Shao
     (c) Smooth extended TBB (SETBB) by Gregory et al.
