# Summary
We present a MATLAB toolbox called BLeS for selecting block length, the primary tuning parameter in block bootstrap, a resampling method for estimating an empirical distribution of dependent data. This package enables users to select block lengths using various methods provided by different scholars for several well-known block bootstrap approaches. The implementations include the Hall-Horowitz-Jing method, Bühlmann-Künsch method, corrected Politis-White method, and the nonparametric plug-in method. This toolbox has been tested using different examples from published articles, and a simulation study illustrating its range and functionality has been presented. BLeS is also supported in Octave.
